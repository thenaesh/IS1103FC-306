\section{Conclusion}
  \paragraph{}
    We have shown that FOMO is indeed a TRPD, a psychological disorder that has been brought about primarily as a consequence of the advent of cybertechnology, with the aid of two prominent contemporary examples. Furthermore, the sheer magnitude of the damage wrought upon individuals as a result of FOMO shows that it is indeed worth looking into and mitigated if necessary. We have looked at some strategies to mitigate FOMO, involving regulatory as well as educational measures.
  \paragraph{}
    With such measures in place, society and individuals will finally be able to fully utilise and benefit from modern technologies without worrying about psychological disorders like FOMO induced by them.
